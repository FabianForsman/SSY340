## Detailed Results

### Clustering Quality Metrics

| Metric | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | simcse-bert | Winner |
|--------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Silhouette Score** ↑ | **0.0311** | 0.0278 | ✅ SBERT |
| **Davies-Bouldin Index** ↓ | 4.4347 | **3.8493** | ✅ SimCSE |
| **Cluster Purity** ↑ | **71.58%** | 67.92% | ✅ SBERT |
| **Inertia** | 3,590 | 246,887 | N/A (different scales) |

**Note**: ↑ = higher is better, ↓ = lower is better

### Interpretation

#### 1. Silhouette Score (0.0311 vs 0.0278)
- **What it measures**: How well-separated clusters are
- **Range**: -1 (worst) to +1 (best)
- **Result**: SBERT slightly better (+11.9%)
- **Conclusion**: Both models show poor cluster separation (~0.03), indicating hate speech classes heavily overlap in embedding space

#### 2. Davies-Bouldin Index (4.43 vs 3.85)
- **What it measures**: Ratio of within-cluster to between-cluster distances
- **Range**: 0 (best) to ∞ (worst)
- **Result**: SimCSE better (-13.2%)
- **Conclusion**: SimCSE creates slightly more compact clusters with better separation

#### 3. Cluster Purity (71.58% vs 67.92%)
- **What it measures**: % of samples correctly grouped by true label
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Result**: SBERT better (+5.4%)
- **Conclusion**: SBERT clusters are more homogeneous - fewer mixed labels per cluster

### Overall Ranking

Based on average rank across all metrics:

**Rank 1: all-MiniLM-L6-v2** (Average rank: 1.33)
- Best at: Silhouette Score, Cluster Purity
- Wins: 2 out of 3 metrics

**Rank 2: simcse-bert** (Average rank: 1.67)
- Best at: Davies-Bouldin Index
- Wins: 1 out of 3 metrics

## t-SNE Visualizations

The t-SNE plots (see `outputs/comparison/tsne_comparison.png`) reveal:

### all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **By True Labels**: Shows significant class overlap
  - Hate and Offensive samples intermixed
  - Neither class has some separation but overlaps with others
- **By Clusters**: 12 clusters spread across the space
  - No clear cluster boundaries
  - Multiple clusters per true label

### simcse-bert
- **By True Labels**: Similar overlap pattern to SBERT
  - Classes not linearly separable
  - Dense central region with mixed labels
- **By Clusters**: More diffuse clustering
  - Higher dimensional space (768D) may cause sparsity
  - Clusters less compact than SBERT

**Conclusion**: Both models struggle to separate hate speech classes in 2D projection, confirming that this is fundamentally a difficult clustering task.

## Performance Comparison

### Encoding Speed

| Model | Encoding Time (5000 samples) | Speed |
|-------|----------------------------|-------|
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | ~7 seconds | **20 samples/sec** |
| simcse-bert | ~31 seconds | 5 samples/sec |

**Winner**: SBERT is **4.4x faster**

### Memory Footprint

| Model | Embedding Dimension | Memory per Sample |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | 1.5 KB |
| simcse-bert | 768 | 3.0 KB |

**Winner**: SBERT uses **50% less memory**

## Why SBERT Performs Better

Despite SimCSE being specifically designed for contrastive learning and semantic similarity, SBERT performs better for hate speech clustering:

### 1. **Optimized for Short Texts**
- SBERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is explicitly designed for tweets and short texts
- SimCSE is trained on longer text sequences (NLI datasets)
- Hate speech tweets are short (avg ~15 words)

### 2. **Better Calibrated for Diversity**
- SBERT's training includes diverse domains
- SimCSE's contrastive learning may over-cluster semantically similar texts
- Hate speech requires distinguishing subtle differences in intent

### 3. **Lower Dimensionality = Better Generalization**
- 384 dimensions may reduce overfitting to training distribution
- 768 dimensions might capture noise in this small dataset
- Curse of dimensionality affects clustering in high-D spaces

### 4. **Computational Efficiency**
- Faster encoding enables rapid iteration
- Lower memory allows larger batch sizes
- Better for production deployment

## Recommendations

### For This Project

1. **Use all-MiniLM-L6-v2** as the embedding model
   - Better clustering quality (71.58% purity vs 67.92%)
   - Faster and more efficient
   - Already integrated into pipeline

2. **Don't expect miracles from embeddings**
   - Both models show poor silhouette scores (~0.03)
   - Clustering-based approaches inherently limited
   - Consider supervised learning instead

### When to Use SimCSE

SimCSE might be better for:
- **Semantic search** tasks (finding similar documents)
- **Duplicate detection** (identifying paraphrases)
- **Longer text** (paragraphs, documents)
- Tasks where **fine-grained similarity** matters more than clustering

### When to Use SBERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

SBERT is better for:
- **Short texts** (tweets, reviews, questions)
- **Clustering** tasks where speed matters
- **Production systems** with limited compute
- **Multi-domain** applications

---

## Alternative Approaches

Since both embeddings show poor clustering quality, consider:

### 1. Supervised Learning (Recommended)
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Train on SBERT embeddings
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
clf.fit(embeddings_train, labels_train)

# Expected accuracy: 60-70% (vs 32% with clustering)
```

### 2. Fine-tune SBERT on Hate Speech Domain
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, losses

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
# Fine-tune with triplet loss on hate speech examples
# Expected improvement: +5-10% clustering quality
```

### 3. Use Domain-Specific Models
- **HateBERT**: Pre-trained on hate speech corpus
- **ToxicBERT**: Trained on toxic comment data
- These may provide better embeddings for this specific task

## Conclusion

**For hate speech detection clustering, all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (SBERT) is the better choice:**

✅ **Advantages**:
- Higher cluster purity (71.58%)
- Better silhouette score (0.0311)
- 4.4x faster encoding
- 50% lower memory usage
- Optimized for short texts

❌ **Disadvantages of SimCSE**:
- Slower encoding (31s vs 7s)
- Lower cluster purity (67.92%)
- Higher dimensional embeddings (768 vs 384)
- Not optimized for tweets

**However**, both models show fundamental limitations:
- Silhouette scores near zero indicate poor clustering
- Classes overlap heavily in embedding space
- Semi-supervised clustering achieved only 32.95% accuracy

**Final Recommendation**: Use SBERT embeddings with **supervised learning** rather than clustering-based semi-supervised learning. With 28,208 labeled samples, supervised methods should achieve 2-3x better performance.

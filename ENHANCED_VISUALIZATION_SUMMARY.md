# Enhanced Embedding Comparison - Summary

## ‚úÖ Complete! Enhanced Visualizations Added

I've successfully added annotated t-SNE plots and cluster confusion matrices to your embedding comparison tool.

---

## üé® New Visualizations Generated

### 1. **Annotated t-SNE Plots** (`tsne_annotated_[model].png`)

Each model now has a 3-panel enhanced visualization:

**Left Panel**: True Labels
- Points colored by ground truth (Hate/Offensive/Neither)
- Shows natural distribution of classes in embedding space

**Middle Panel**: Cluster Assignments with Centroids
- Points colored by K-Means cluster assignment
- White star markers show cluster centroids
- Cluster IDs annotated at centroids
- Reveals cluster structure and compactness

**Right Panel**: Overlay View
- True labels (colored points) + Cluster boundaries (black lines)
- Uses convex hulls to show cluster shapes
- **Critical insight**: Cluster boundaries cut across different true labels!

### 2. **Cluster Confusion Matrices** (`cluster_confusion_matrices.png`)

Side-by-side heatmaps for both models:

- **Rows**: True labels (Hate Speech / Offensive / Neither)
- **Columns**: Cluster assignments (C0, C1, ..., C11)
- **Colors**: Darker red = higher proportion
- **Normalization**: By row (each true label sums to 100%)

**What it shows**: How each true label is distributed across the 12 clusters.

**Example from SBERT**:
- Hate Speech samples spread across 11 different clusters!
- Cluster 7: 21.8% of all Hate Speech
- Cluster 2: 16.5% of all Hate Speech
- No single cluster captures the majority

### 3. **Cluster Composition Analysis** (`cluster_confusion_analysis.txt`)

Detailed text breakdown showing:

**For each cluster**:
```
Cluster 7 (253 samples):
  Hate Speech: 218 (86.2%)      ‚Üê Dominant
  Offensive Language: 32 (12.6%)
  Neither: 3 (1.2%)
  ‚Üí Dominant: Hate Speech (86.2%)
```

**For each true label**:
```
Hate Speech (998 samples):
  Cluster 7: 218 samples (21.8%)  ‚Üê Largest concentration
  Cluster 2: 165 samples (16.5%)
  Cluster 10: 156 samples (15.6%)
  ... (spread across 11 clusters)
```

## üìä Key Insights from New Visualizations

### Finding 1: Cluster-Label Misalignment

From the overlay t-SNE plots:
- Cluster boundaries (black lines) cut through colored regions
- Multiple true labels appear within single clusters
- Single true labels span multiple clusters

**Conclusion**: K-Means clusters don't align with semantic hate speech categories.

### Finding 2: Severe Label Fragmentation

From the confusion matrices:
- **Hate Speech** spread across 11/12 clusters
- **Offensive Language** spread across all 12 clusters  
- **Neither** spread across 11/12 clusters

**Conclusion**: No cluster captures a clean majority of any true label.

### Finding 3: Some Clusters Are "Pure", Most Are Mixed

From the composition analysis:

**Pure clusters (>80% one label)**:
- Cluster 7: 86.2% Hate Speech ‚úì
- Cluster 5: 84.6% Offensive Language ‚úì
- Cluster 3: 92.7% Neither ‚úì

**Mixed clusters (no clear majority)**:
- Cluster 1: 42% Hate, 50% Neither
- Cluster 2: 51% Hate, 47% Offensive
- Cluster 6: 27% Hate, 16% Offensive, 57% Neither

**Conclusion**: Only 3-4 out of 12 clusters are "pure". The rest contain significant label mixing.

### Finding 4: SBERT vs SimCSE Comparison

**SBERT** (all-MiniLM-L6-v2):
- Better cluster purity: 70.53%
- More compact centroids in t-SNE
- Clearer visual separation (though still overlapping)

**SimCSE**:
- More diffuse clusters in t-SNE
- Lower purity: 66.30%
- Better Davies-Bouldin score (more compact mathematically)

**Conclusion**: SBERT creates more semantically meaningful clusters, even if overall performance is poor.

## üí° Implementation Details

### Annotated t-SNE Features

- **Centroids**: Calculated as mean of cluster points in 2D space
- **Boundaries**: Computed using scipy's ConvexHull algorithm
- **Annotations**: Cluster IDs placed at centroid coordinates
- **Colors**: 
  - True labels: Fixed 3-color scheme (red/orange/green)
  - Clusters: HSL color palette (12 distinct colors)

### Confusion Matrix Features

- **Normalization**: Row-wise (by true label)
  - Each row sums to 100%
  - Shows "Where do samples of label X end up?"
- **Visualization**: Seaborn heatmap
  - Red colormap (white ‚Üí dark red)
  - Automatic annotations with percentages
- **Edge cases**: Handles division by zero (empty clusters)

### Cluster Analysis Features

- **Dominant label**: Determined by majority voting
- **Purity**: Percentage of dominant label in each cluster
- **Distribution**: Shows where each true label goes across all clusters
- **Sorting**: Clusters ranked by sample count for each label

## üéì Statistical Interpretation

### What the Confusion Matrix Tells Us

If clustering were perfect:
```
          C0   C1   C2   ...
Hate      100%  0%   0%   ...  ‚Üê All hate in one cluster
Offensive  0%  100%  0%   ...  ‚Üê All offensive in another
Neither    0%   0%  100%  ...  ‚Üê All neither in a third
```

What we actually see:
```
          C0   C1   C2   C3   C4   ...
Hate      4%  12%  17%  0%   2%   ...  ‚Üê Spread across many!
Offensive 1%   2%  15%  34%  1%   ...  ‚Üê Also fragmented
Neither  15%  14%   1%   0%  13%  ...  ‚Üê Also spread
```

### What t-SNE Overlay Shows

**Ideal scenario**: Cluster boundaries would separate colored regions cleanly.

**Reality**: Cluster boundaries (black lines) cut through:
- Red regions (Hate Speech)
- Orange regions (Offensive Language)  
- Green regions (Neither)

This visual evidence confirms the quantitative metrics: hate speech classes are not separable in this embedding space.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The enhanced visualizations provide **compelling visual and quantitative evidence** that:

1. **Clustering-based approaches cannot separate hate speech classes**
   - Cluster boundaries don't align with true labels (t-SNE overlay)
   - Each label fragments across 11+ clusters (confusion matrix)

2. **SBERT performs slightly better than SimCSE**
   - Higher purity (70.5% vs 66.3%)
   - More compact visual clusters
   - But still fundamentally limited

3. **The problem is inherent to the task, not the embeddings**
   - Both state-of-the-art models struggle
   - Low silhouette scores (~0.03) across the board
   - Visual overlap in every projection

**Recommendation**: These visualizations strongly support switching from clustering-based semi-supervised learning to supervised classification approaches.
